A set of tools to help build Japanese flash card decks for Japanese vocabulary.

I started this project with the goal of automating the process of extracting vocabulary from text dumps of games and the like, so that I may be able to study vocabulary I would need to learn to play them in Japanese.

 Of course, this tool can be used to find Japanese vocabulary in any block of text. I would love to use this for things like song lyrics and books in the future.

 I had an older version of this program in progress but I decided to restart from scratch with a better mindset and after I learned some more skills in school.
